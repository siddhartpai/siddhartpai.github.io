				The open office layout increases the seating space for employees. This helps teams grow in horizontal scale very fast. It is used to maximize the use of office space. Office space increases exponentially and the team is able to seat a lot more number of people. The degrees of interaction between people also increases with the change in layout to an open office space. Now people from the other end of the office are reminded that you can solve their problem instead of jsut asking around first. With the closed office layout people are restricted in their own area. One person only has to at maximum field questions only from 8 people. When that changes to an open office layout people start interacting more and working less.

				Offices aren't a place for distraction. They are meant to be a place for focus and getting work done. When there is no focus, there can't be much work done at all. In a closed office layout there is a place for focus. This small space or a pod allows for focused growth. A small team can get a lot of work done by helping each other. Open office layout increases collaboration between employees but when you are building a product and need people to be focused on building stuff, there is lesser need for employee wide collaboration. Collaboration is necessary but this should happen as flow of information from teams to teams. This creates the right culture when building a product as people are interacting more through emails than through word of mouth. A lot of information can be lost in word of mouth, but the clear advantage in email is that information is always maintained. More communication happens through emails, less through speaking. People speak a lot of stuff which is unnecessary and only the right communication is passed between teams. Gossip and unnecessary talk is further reduced with the closed office layout.

				While we maximize the office_space vector we need to be mindful of the fact that we are also increasing degrees of interaction which in turn leads to a decrease in productivity.
